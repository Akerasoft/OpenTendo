# NES-RE
A project to Reverse-Engineer the original NES motherboard for documentation purposes.

The end goal is to document the board layout, then to produce board files, schematics, and a bill of materials.
The design will be as true to the original board as possible, with subtle changes where needed to compensate for outdated/unsourcable parts,
as well as some improvements. (Expansion audio enabled, CIC clone that only handles reset and lacks lockout functionality {hopefully}, and other minor changes)

Since this project is open-source you may do as you like with it, whether that is to make boards for personal use, sell "Upgraded" NES boards, or to use the provided info for further custom PCB work/designs.






I am not in any way affiliated with Nintendo, I'm just doing this in my free time as a stepping stone into further Reverse Engineering work.
